[World Indicators.csv](https://github.com/shahkimaya/Clustering-on-Real-world-Data/files/10190271/World.Indicators.csv)

The world indicators dataset compares different countries based on selected attributes.
1. Use  K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to group similar countries together
2. Use Internal validation metrics to report the cluster quality
3. Report the best clustering solution. Give a detailed list of all the groups and the countries included within the groups
4. Generate three different scatter plots of your choice and color the data points according to the group.Example: “Life expectancyvs GDP”,  “Infant Mortality vs
GDP”, etc.
